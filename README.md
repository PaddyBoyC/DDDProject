This projected tasked me to design, develop and test a program that will allow users/stakeholders of the system to perform the usage scenarios described below.

For this project I needed to follow a structured approach to analyse, specify, model, develop and test an application to deliver benefit to students and staff.

There were several stakeholders in this system:

The Student
The Personal Supervisor (PS)
The Senior Tutor (ST)
Through your analysis, you may, and are free to, identify others.

The key usage scenarios are as follows:

A student should be able to self report how they are feeling / progressing at fixed time intervals.
The PS should be able to review the status of all of their students,
The PS should be book a meeting with students
The student should be able to book a meeting with the PS
The ST should be able to see the status of all students and how the PS are interacting with the students
